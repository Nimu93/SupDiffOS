# SUPDIFFOS

**SUPDIFFOS** is my fun and experimental operating system where I dive into the basics of kernel development and low-level programming. 

The ultimate goal? To tilt Arthur, because he dares to play support in League of Legends. ðŸ˜‰

Stay tuned as SUPDIFFOS growsâ€”maybe one day it'll become the kernel-level proof of why *SUP DIFF* is real!
